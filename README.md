# FSM

 Finite State Machine header-only library, with which you can process an input string and perform pre-defined actions based on the result of its analysis of the conditions.
 Both the Conditions and the Actions are given by the main application, while the FSM is implemented in a single header.
 An example is given in FSM.cpp, which is processing a string implementation of the Rubik's Pocket Cube, and returns the Faces and Directions.
